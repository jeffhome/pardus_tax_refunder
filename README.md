# Pardus Tax Refunder
Assist in processing tax refunds based on pilot activity for use by an Alliance Treasurer within Pardus (a MMORPG set in space).

## What is this?

This is a web extension that extends either Firefox or Chrome, adding some extra functionality for Alliance Treasurers to assist them in the process of tax refunds (particularly for large alliances).

## What does it do?

The Pardus Tax Refunder web extension does not send any data anywhere, but uses data from the Alliance Tax logs and Membership Activity to determine whether a refund should happen (or not).

## Why have you made it?

After the release of Firefox v57 (Quantum) and the changes required for existing userscripts, I decided to bypass the likes of TamperMonkey and Greasemonkey by bundling my userscript functionality into a native web extension.

## What am I supposed to do with it?

You can clone this repository and use the `build.sh` script to build the extension (for either Chrome, Firefox, or for both).

You might instead want to get the latest version from the following:

 * [Mozilla Addons - Pardus Tax Refunder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pardus-tax-refunder) (Firefox)
 * [Chrome Store - Pardus Tax Refunder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pardus-tax-refunder/afgfmhadckoceglegjcafilofgmlehpb) (Chrome)

And unless you are playing [Pardus - a MMORPG set in space](http://www.pardus.at/) and are a Treasurer for an Alliance, then you will find this web extension of little use.
